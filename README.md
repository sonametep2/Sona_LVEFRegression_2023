This study highlights the potential of ECG features derived from 24-hour recordings as a promising alternative to the current echocardiography gold standard for finding LVEF levels in CAD patients. From a machine learning perspective, the developed approach offers valuable insights into finding ECG patterns suitable for accurately estimating LVEF in different heart failure categories (preserved, midrange, and reduced).
Furthermore, the proposed study aims to extend the application of LVEF assessment to communities where access to the required instruments is limited due to economic challenges or lack of clinical expertise. The study's outcomes hold the potential to aid the development of a model to predict the HF phenotype or track its changes during therapy, providing a versatile tool for exploring disease pathophysiology and objectively assessing therapeutic approaches in future HF patients.
Notably, the proposed machine learning model offers simplicity, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, enabling continuous cardiac analysis and representing a viable alternative to more elaborated gold standard techniques. As research advances, using more extensive datasets and leveraging deep learning techniques will help compare the proposed model's performance to other methods. Overall, this research contributes to advancing the field of ECG-based LVEF estimation and its potential applicability, particularly in resource-constrained settings.
